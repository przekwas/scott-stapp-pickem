## 🤘 Theming

Given this whole thing started as an inside joke/meme amongst friends about Creed, throwing in random Creed and Scott Stapp references all ove the place is highly encouraged

&nbsp;

## 🧠 Brainstorming Pages

&nbsp;

#### Login

email and password fields should suffice

&nbsp;

#### Register

first name, last name, email, username, and password fields - username validation will be upper/lower case a-z, underscore, and 1-9 - passwords will be hashed/salted in case someone is worried i plain text it lol

&nbsp;

#### Standings

display current standings among players, ordered by highest score to lowest score - separate pages for full overview of week to week or possibly filters on current page?

&nbsp;

#### Profile

possible edit personal details form options, teams picked this season, current week's pick with edit option if avail, total score so far, successful and failed picks this season

&nbsp;

#### Picks

displays this weeks matches (we do Thurs to Mon as a week), disabling completed, on-going, and matches with <5min to kickoff time (this math is gonna suck), modal confirm when saving their week's peek - possibly also disabling a team if they already picked it
